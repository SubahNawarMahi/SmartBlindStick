# SmartBlindStick
CSE-3104 Peripheral Project

This project for assisting blind people in their daily life.
The stick features sensors that detect obstructions or walls within a 15cm radius. 
It produces a buzzing sound and vibrates. To find any holes larger than 15 cm, another sonar is utilized under the stick.Â Thus, this Smart Stick alerts the blind person when a wall or impediment is in his path.
When a fire is detected, a vibration motor and buzzer are activated at the same time. It uses a frequency of sound that is different from other buzzers so that a blind person may easily tell that it is a fire alarm. Due to their exceptionally keen hearing, blind people can distinguish between different noises with ease and take appropriate action.
